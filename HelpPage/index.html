<div id="opmode">
     <h2> Opmodes </h2>
     <p>
          Opmodes are the way that you can make code appear on the robot.
          They are defined the same way as normal classes, but with a few extras.
          They follow a simple template that goes like this:

          <br>
          <br>

     <pre class="code" id="opModeDefinition">
public class <a id="opModeName">OpModeName</a> extends OperationMode implements TeleOperation {
	@Override
	public void contruct() { 
		
	} 
	
	@Override
	public void run() {
	
	}
}	</pre>

     Opmode Name: <input id="classNameID" name="className" type="text" value="OpModeName" placeholder="Op Mode Name">
     <br>
     <button onclick='changeField("classNameID", "opModeName")'>Apply</button>

     <br>
     <br>

     There are two functions there: construct and run. construct is run once at the beginning before the opMode starts,
     and run is run periodically after it starts. It is important that you don't keep any long loops in the run function
     or you may cause an error to occur.
     <br>
     <br>
     To make an autonomous routine, swap the TeleOperation at the top to AutonomousOperation.
     <br>
     <br>
     OpModes has a special varieable, environment, that allows for you to run special functions, set special
     variables, and add additional features.

<div id="hardware">
     <h2> Hardware </h2>
     <p>
          Hardware is the way that you can interact with the robot's physical features.
          Hardware is the term for things like motors, gamepads, servos, and sensors.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hardware devices can be interacted with using the HardwareGetter class.
          Note that some hardware must be initialized before it can be used.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hardware uses a system which I call "Requests". Requests have a two-part system.
          First, a request must actually be created, then you can call that request. Requests can
          be used in any part of the script, and some advantages will be explained later.

          <h3> Motors </h3>
          Motors must have a request active before they are used. To initialize a motor request, use the code below,
          but make sure that the name matches that set in the robot configuration.
          <br>

          <pre class="code" id="motorInit">
HardwareGetter.makeMotorRequest("<a id="motorNameInitSample">motorName</a>");</pre>


          Motor Name: <input id="motorNameInitInputID" name="motorNameInitInput" type="text" value="motorName"
                              placeholder="Motor Name">
          <br>
          <button onclick='changeField("motorNameInitInputID", "motorNameInitSample")'>Apply</button>

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Once a request is created, you can do all sorts of things with it. Before you can use it,
          you need to know what paramaters you want it to have. There are 3 main paramaters:
          They are power, the motor's name, and the operation type. See more about operation types below.

     <pre class="code" id="motorUsage">
HardwareGetter.setMotorValue("<a id="motorNameUsageSample">motorName</a>", new StandardMotorParameters(
          <a id="motorPowerUsageSample">1</a>,
          MotorOperation.<a id="motorOperationUsageSample">POWER</a>)); </pre>

     Motor Name: <input id="motorNameUsageInputID" name="motorNameInitInput" type="text" value="motorName"
                        placeholder="Motor Name">
     <br>
     <button onclick='changeField("motorNameUsageInputID", "motorNameUsageSample")'>Apply</button>
     </p>
     Motor Power: <input id="motorPowerUsageInputID" name="motorPowerInitInput" type="text" value="1"
                        placeholder="Motor Power">
     <br>
     <button onclick='changeField("motorPowerUsageInputID", "motorPowerUsageSample")'>Apply</button>

     <br>
     <br>

     Motor Operation: <select id="motorOperationUsageInputID" name="motorOperationUsageInput">
          <option value="POWER">POWER</option>
          <option value="ENCODER_POWER">ENCODER_POWER</option>
          <option value="ENCODER_DISTANCE">ENCODER_DISTANCE</option>
     </select>
     <br>
     <button onclick='changeField("motorOperationUsageInputID", "motorOperationUsageSample")'>Apply</button>

     <h4>Operation Types</h4>

     There are three big operation types: POWER, ENCODER_POWER, and ENCODER_DISTANCE.

     <br>
     <br>
     POWER accepts a value between -1 and 1, and will set the motor to that value. This is the most useful.
     <br>
     <br>
     ENCODER_POWER accepts a value between -1 and 1, and will set the motor to that value, but will also adjust it to
     keep the speed of the robot consistent. It does this by using a device called an "encoder".
     <br>
     <br>
     ENCODER_DISTANCE accepts any value and will drive the motor to that many "counts", which are a small fraction of
     one revolution.
     To find out how what the input should be for this, use this sample formula:
     <pre class="code">
counts_per_inch = (counts_per_rev * gear_ratio) / (wheel_diameter * PI)</pre>
     <br>
     Counts per inch: The amount of counts that the encoder to do to get the robot to move 1 inch. If you multiply this value
     by any distance (in inches), then you will get the number of encoder counts needed to move the robot that distance.
     <br>
     <br>
     Counts per rev: The amount of counts that the encoder has per revolution of the motor internally. For most
     motors this is 1440, but you can look this information up online for the motor if you need to.
     <br>
     <br>
     Gear Ratio: The ratio of the gears in between the motor and the wheel. You can see this information on the
     gearbox attatched to the motor, if there is no external gearbox, assume that this is 1.
     <br>
     <br>
     Wheel Diameter: The diameter (in inches) of the wheel that the motor is attached to.

     <br>
     <br>
     <h3>Gamepads</h3>

     If you just scrolled past the long section about motors and thought "You know what.... this hurts my brain!", then
     great, because it took me two hours to write.
     <br>
     <br>
     But do not fear, because gamepads are pretty simple.
     <br>
     They work on the same request system as motors, but require fewer inputs, and are initialized for you!
     <br>
     <br>
     To interact with a gamepad, you need to know a few things:
     <br>
     <br>
     First, you need to know which gamepad you want to use. You can choose between two, which are called "gamepad1" and "gamepad2".
     <br>
     <br>
     Second, you need to know which type of gamepad you want to use, which are either Xbox style, which have A B X Y
     as the labels on the four buttons on the front of the controller, or PlayStation style, which have the weird shapes
     as labels on the four buttons on the front of the controller.
     <br>
     <br>
     Third, you need to know which button you want to use. There are quite a lot, so here is a list of them, however
     they should be in all uppercase, but that would be too much work, and I don't have enough caffeine.

     <pre class="code">
GENERIC BUTTONS
     dpad_up
     dpad_down
     dpad_left
     dpad_right
     left_stick_button
     right_stick_button
     left_bumper
     right_bumper

GENERIC AXES
     left_trigger
     right_trigger
     left_stick_x
     left_stick_y
     right_stick_x
     right_stick_y

XBOX-ONLY BUTTONS
     a
     b
     x
     y
     back
     start
     guide

PLAYSTATION-ONLY BUTTONS
     circle
     cross
     square
     triangle
     share
     options
     touchpad
     touchpad_finger_1
     touchpad_finger_2
     ps

PLAYSTATION-ONLY AXES
     touchpad_finger_1_x
     touchpad_finger_1_y
     touchpad_finger_2_x
     touchpad_finger_2_y
     </pre>

     Note that some of those buttons, are axes, rather than buttons. Axes will return a value between -1 and 1, with
     the exception of the touchpad of the playstation controller, which we never use. Buttons will return a value
     that is either 0 or 1, 0 being not pressed, and 1 being pressed. To use the gamepad, look at the code snippet
     below:

     <pre class="code">
HardwareGetter.getGamepadValue("<a id="gamepadNameSample">gamepad1</a>", GamepadRequestInput.<a
               id="gamepadButtonSample">DPAD_UP</a>);</pre>
     <br>
     Gamepad Name: <select id="gamepadNameInputID" name="gamepadNameInput">
          <option value="gamepad1">gamepad1</option>
          <option value="gamepad2">gamepad2</option>
     </select>

     <button onclick='changeField("gamepadNameInputID", "gamepadNameSample")'>Apply</button>
