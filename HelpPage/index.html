<div id="opmode">
     <h2> Opmodes </h2>
     <p>
          Opmodes are the way that you can make code appear on the robot.
          They are defined the same way as normal classes, but with a few extras.
          They follow a simple template that goes like this:

          <br>
          <br>

     <pre class="code" id="opModeDefinition">
public class <a id="opModeName">OpModeName</a> extends OperationMode implements TeleOperation {
	@Override
	public void contruct() { 
		
	} 
	
	@Override
	public void run() {
	
	}
}	</pre>

     Opmode Name: <input id="classNameID" name="className" type="text" value="OpModeName" placeholder="Op Mode Name">
     <br>
     <button onclick='changeField("classNameID", "opModeName")'>Apply</button>

     <br>
     <br>

     There are two functions there: construct and run. construct is run once at the beginning before the opMode starts,
     and run is run periodically after it starts. It is important that you don't keep any long loops in the run function
     or you may cause an error to occur.
     <br>
     <br>
     To make an autonomous routine, swap the TeleOperation at the top to AutonomousOperation.
     <br>
     <br>
     OpModes has a special varieable, environment, that allows for you to run special functions, set special
     variables, and add additional features.

<div id="hardware">
     <h2> Hardware </h2>
     <p>
          Hardware is the way that you can interact with the robot's physical features.
          Hardware is the term for things like motors, gamepads, servos, and sensors.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hardware devices can be interacted with using the HardwareGetter class.
          Note that some hardware must be initialized before it can be used.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hardware uses a system which I call "Requests". Requests have a two-part system.
          First, a request must actually be created, then you can call that request. Requests can
          be used in any part of the script, and some advantages will be explained later.

          <h3> Motors </h3>
          Motors must have a request active before they are used. To initialize a motor request, use the code below,
          but make sure that the name matches that set in the robot configuration.
          <br>

          <pre class="code" id="motorInit">
HardwareGetter.makeMotorRequest("<a id="motorNameInitSample">motorName</a>");</pre>


          Motor Name: <input id="motorNameInitInputID" name="motorNameInitInput" type="text" value="motorName"
                              placeholder="Motor Name">
          <br>
          <button onclick='changeField("motorNameInitInputID", "motorNameInitSample")'>Apply</button>

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Once a request is created, you can do all sorts of things with it. Before you can use it,
          you need to know what paramaters you want it to have. There are 3 main paramaters:
          They are power, the motor's name, and the operation type. See more about operation types below.

     <pre class="code" id="motorUsage">
HardwareGetter.setMotorValue("<a id="motorNameUsageSample">motorName</a>", new StandardMotorParameters(
          <a id="motorPowerUsageSample">1</a>,
          MotorOperation.<a id="motorOperationUsageSample">POWER</a>)); </pre>

     Motor Name: <input id="motorNameUsageInputID" name="motorNameInitInput" type="text" value="motorName"
                        placeholder="Motor Name">
     <br>
     <button onclick='changeField("motorNameUsageInputID", "motorNameUsageSample")'>Apply</button>
     </p>
     Motor Power: <input id="motorPowerUsageInputID" name="motorPowerInitInput" type="text" value="1"
                        placeholder="Motor Power">
     <br>
     <button onclick='changeField("motorPowerUsageInputID", "motorPowerUsageSample")'>Apply</button>

     <br>
     <br>

     Motor Operation: <select id="motorOperationUsageInputID" name="motorOperationUsageInput">
          <option value="POWER">POWER</option>
          <option value="ENCODER_POWER">ENCODER_POWER</option>
          <option value="ENCODER_DISTANCE">ENCODER_DISTANCE</option>
     </select>
     <br>
     <button onclick='changeField("motorOperationUsageInputID", "motorOperationUsageSample")'>Apply</button>

     <h4>Operation Types</h4>

     There are three big operation types: POWER, ENCODER_POWER, and ENCODER_DISTANCE.

     <br>
     <br>
     POWER accepts a value between -1 and 1, and will set the motor to that value. This is the most useful.
     <br>
     <br>
     ENCODER_POWER accepts a value between -1 and 1, and will set the motor to that value, but will also adjust it to
     keep the speed of the robot consistent. It does this by using a device called an "encoder".
     <br>
     <br>
     ENCODER_DISTANCE accepts any value and will drive the motor to that many "counts", which are a small fraction of
     one revolution.
     To find out how what the input should be for this, use this sample formula:
     <pre class="code">
counts_per_inch = (counts_per_rev * gear_ratio) / (wheel_diameter * PI)</pre>
     <br>
     Counts per inch: The amount of counts that the encoder to do to get the robot to move 1 inch. If you multiply this value
     by any distance (in inches), then you will get the number of encoder counts needed to move the robot that distance.
     <br>
     <br>
     Counts per rev: The amount of counts that the encoder has per revolution of the motor internally. For most
     motors this is 1440, but you can look this information up online for the motor if you need to.
     <br>
     <br>
     Gear Ratio: The ratio of the gears in between the motor and the wheel. You can see this information on the
     gearbox attatched to the motor, if there is no external gearbox, assume that this is 1.
     <br>
     <br>
     Wheel Diameter: The diameter (in inches) of the wheel that the motor is attached to.
